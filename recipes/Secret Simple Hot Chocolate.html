    <h3>I was experimenting in the kitchen with milk and sugar, when suddenly the idea of chocolate came to my mind.
         I looked in the cabinet and saw a fresh bottle of chocolate syrup.
          I added it to my hot cup of milk and sugar and ta-da! Secret simple hot chocolate!
           Add marshmallows, whipped cream, or Cool WhipÂ® to make even tastier.</h3>
